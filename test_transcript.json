    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm thinking Python with Flask for the backend"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Flask is a solid choice for a lightweight API. For the database, SQLite would work for prototyping, or PostgreSQL for production."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Let's go with PostgreSQL since I want this to scale"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good decision. You'll want to use SQLAlchemy as your ORM to interact with PostgreSQL."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What about the frontend?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "For a simple expense tracker, you could use React or even plain HTML with HTMX for interactivity."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'll try React since I want to learn it"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That works. You'll need to set up CORS on your Flask backend to allow React to make API calls."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How should I structure the database tables?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Start with a users table, an expenses table with amount, category, date, and description fields, and a foreign key linking expenses to users."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Should I add authentication?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, JWT tokens work well with Flask. Use Flask-JWT-Extended for handling auth."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What about password storage?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Never store plain text passwords. Use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. Now how do I deploy this?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the backend, Railway or Render offer free tiers. For React, Vercel or Netlify work great."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I think I'll use Railway for both"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That simplifies things. You can deploy Flask and PostgreSQL together on Railway."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "One more thing - should I add expense categories?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, a categories table would help. Users can then filter and analyze spending by category."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Like food, transport, entertainment?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. You could either hardcode common categories or let users create custom ones."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Custom categories sound better"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then add a categories table with user_id as a foreign key, so each user has their own categories."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "This is really helpful, thanks!"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Happy to help. Start with the database schema and authentication, then build out the expense CRUD operations."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What order should I build things in?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Database models with SQLAlchemy. 2. User registration and login. 3. Expense CRUD endpoints. 4. React frontend. 5. Deploy."},
