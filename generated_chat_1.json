    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Sure! To find the derivative, we'll use the power rule for each term. The power rule states that d/dx[x^n] = nx^(n-1). Let's apply this to each term in your function."

    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Exactly right! For 3x^4, you bring down the 4 and multiply it by 3 to get 12, then reduce the power by 1 to get 12x^3. Now try the second term: -2x^3."

    {
        "role": "assistant",
